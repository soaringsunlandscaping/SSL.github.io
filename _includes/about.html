                <p><font size="4px"> Ying is a first-generation college student who immigrated to the US from rural China when she was young. She grew up in Las Vegas, NV, obtained a BS in in Biochemistry, Cell Biology at UCSD and was a McNair Scholar. As a NSF GRFP fellow, she obtained her PhD from Stanford University with Dr. Jos√© Dinneny where she analyzes the genomes of plants that live in extreme environments and utilizes bioinformatics tools to connect genotype to phenotype. She is currently a postdoc at UC Riverside and working with Dr. Sue Wessler and Dr. Jason Stajich to understand the impact of transposable elements in rice. Ying is innovative, collaborative, and excited to make an impact by focusing on joy and passion in her work. She is a highly skilled scientist in plant biology, bioinformatician, and effective instructor. During her free time, Ying enjoys volunteering, baking, playing with animals, dancing, any outdoor activity, ice skating, and watching TV! She believes in mentorship and advocates for inclusion, equity, diversifying academia and solidarity. She hopes to promote the mindset of having gratitude, respect, and love toward one another in academia.  </font></p>
                <p><font size="4px"> I earned my Ph.D. in Genetics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (2016). The main goal was to integrate plant biology and bioinformatics focusing on the study the differentially expressed genes under drought condition and on identifying mechanisms of response to this stress in castor beans. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4px"> After a year and a half working in a private company in Brazil, I joined <a href="http://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/">Professor Thomas Girke Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.ucr.edu/">UCR</a> in 2017. My current research focuses on the development of computational <a href="http://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/systemPipeR/">data analysis</a> methods for genome biology. My main interests are the development of integrated systems for NGS data analysis for R and Bioconductor open source software projects. The following gives a short summary of my career and the current projects.</font></p>
